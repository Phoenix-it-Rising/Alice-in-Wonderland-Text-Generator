# Alice in Wonderland Text Generator

## Description
A Python-based LSTM model trained on the Alice in Wonderland text to generate new sequences. Demonstrates sequential modeling and text generation using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy

## Features
- Text preprocessing and tokenization
- LSTM-based language modeling
- Randomized text generation from seed phrases

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install tensorflow numpy`
3. Place `alice_in_wonderland.txt` in the project directory.
4. Run: `python Alice.py`

## Notes
- Model trained for 5 epochs due to hardware limitations.
- Future improvements: more epochs, temperature sampling, cloud deployment.
